# 🏘️ Infinitely Generated Overworld Village
This is my first Minecraft project I ever made and released into public and open-sourced yet, anyways
If you are looking to challenge yourself in a completely random minecraft world I introduce you...
A Minecraft datapack that turns your overworld into a pile of villages infinitely!

This datapack currently supports 1.21.8 only and may support older versions soon, and more cursed datapack coming soon!

## 🔧 Installation
**Recommended method**  
1. Create a new world in Minecraft
2. Click **More** → **Datapacks** → **Open Pack Folder** (1.21.8)
3. Drop the datapack `.zip` file of this datapack into folder
4. Back to Minecraft and select and add it → **Done** → Generate the world

**Other method**
1. Drop the datapack `.zip` file into existing world folder and restart (leave and join) the world
2. Datapack should be enabled automatically (You can check by `/datapack list` only 1.21.8)
- If it doesn't listed in active datapack, run `/datapack enable "file/dense-village-overworld.zip"` and restart the world

## ⚠️ Performance Notice
This datapack causes villager structures to generate extremely densely and infinitely each chunks. 
Expect performance impacts, especially during world generation. 
It is **highly recommended** to use high-end PC or optimization mods such as Sodium, Lithium, C2ME or any

## Notes
- In existing worlds villages will not generate in new chunks immediately, you have to locate any vanilla Minecraft village first.
- This datapack's `villages.json` is based on [TVFLabs's datapack](https://github.com/TVFLabs/My-Minecraft-Datapacks) I must thank him for my dedication to creating minecraft projects from this point!
